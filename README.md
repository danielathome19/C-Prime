# About

 Câ€² (C Prime) is a library for the C programming language that includes standard library headers, macros, and functions to provide a more modern and user-friendly experience for C programmers. 
 It includes high-level (C++-like) features:
  - Exception/signal handling, try-catch-finally blocks
  - Function overloading (using macros)
  - Boolean, string, and auto types
  - Simplified input functions (with prompts)
  - String functions (substring, index, toupper/tolower, etc.)
  - Foreach, fori, and arrlen macros
  - File Reader and File Writer classes
  - Etc.
 
This header file is intended to be a drop-in replacement for much of the C standard library and is designed to be used alongside the standard C library headers.
